either forehand backhand players forehand side side playing hand righthanded player forehand side right side backhand side left side forehand strokes hit front hand leading like hitting palm whereas backhand strokes hit back hand leading like hitting knuckles players frequently play certain strokes forehand side backhand hitting action vice versain forecourt midcourt strokes played equally effectively either forehand backhand side rear court players attempt play many strokes possible forehands often preferring play roundthehead forehand overhead forehand backhand side rather attempt backhand overhead playing backhand overhead two main disadvantages first player must turn back opponents restricting view court second backhand overheads cannot hit much power forehands hitting action limited shoulder joint permits much greater range movement forehand overhead backhand backhand clear considered players coaches difficult basic stroke game since precise technique needed order muster enough power shuttlecock travel full length court reason backhand smashes tend weakthe choice stroke depends near shuttlecock net whether net height opponent currently positioned players much better attacking options reach shuttlecock well net height especially also close net forecourt high shuttlecock met net kill hitting steeply downwards attempting win rally immediately best drop shuttlecock net situation midcourt high shuttlecock usually met powerful smash also hitting downwards hoping outright winner weak reply athletic jump smashes players jump upwards steeper smash angle common spectacular element elite mens doubles play rearcourt players strive hit shuttlecock still rather allowing drop lower overhead hitting allows play smashes clears hitting shuttlecock high back opponents court drop shots hitting shuttlecock softly falls sharply downwards opponents forecourt shuttlecock dropped lower smash impossible fulllength high clear difficultwhen shuttlecock well net height players choice hit upwards lifts shuttlecock hit upwards back opponents court played parts court player lift remaining option push shuttlecock softly back net forecourt called net shot midcourt rear court often called push blockwhen shuttlecock near net height players hit drives travel flat rapidly net opponents rear midcourt rear court pushes may also hit flatter placing shuttlecock front midcourt drives pushes may played midcourt forecourt often used doubles attempt regain attack rather choosing lift shuttlecock defend smashes successful drive push opponents often forced lift shuttlecockballs may spun alter bounce example topspin backspin tennis trajectory players may slice ball strike angled racquet face produce spin shuttlecock allowed bounce slicing shuttlecock applications badminton see basic strokes explanation technical termsdue way feathers overlap shuttlecock also slight natural spin axis rotational symmetry spin counterclockwise direction seen dropping shuttlecock natural spin affects certain strokes tumbling net shot effective slicing action right left rather left right19badminton biomechanics subject extensive scientific study studies confirm minor role wrist power generation indicate major contributions power come internal external rotations upper lower arm20 recent guides sport thus emphasize forearm rotation rather wrist movements21the feathers impart substantial drag causing shuttlecock decelerate greatly distance shuttlecock also extremely aerodynamically stable regardless initial orientation turn fly corkfirst remain corkfirst orientationone consequence shuttlecocks drag requires considerable power hit full length court case racquet sports drag also influences flight path lifted lobbed shuttlecock parabola flight heavily skewed falls steeper angle rises high serves shuttlecock may even fall verticallywhen defending smash players three basic options lift block drive singles block net common reply doubles lift safest option usually allows opponents continue smashing blocks drives counterattacking strokes may intercepted smashers partner many players use backhand hitting action returning smashes forehand backhand sides backhands effective forehands covering smashes directed body hard shots directed towards body difficult defendthe service restricted laws presents array stroke choices unlike tennis servers racquet must pointing downward direction deliver serve normally shuttle must hit upwards pass net server choose low serve forecourt like push lift back service court flat drive serve lifted serves may either high serves shuttlecock lifted high falls almost vertically back court flick serves shuttlecock lifted lesser height falls sooneronce players mastered basic strokes hit shuttlecock part court powerfully softly required beyond basics however badminton offers rich potential advanced stroke skills provide competitive advantage badminton players cover short distance quickly possible purpose many advanced strokes deceive opponent either tricked believing different stroke played forced delay movement actually sees shuttles direction deception badminton often used senses player genuinely deceived often lose point immediately cannot change direction quickly enough reach shuttlecock experienced players aware trick cautious move early attempted deception still useful forces opponent delay movement slightly weaker players whose intended strokes obvious experienced player may move shuttlecock hit anticipating stroke gain advantageslicing using shortened hitting action two main technical devices facilitate deception slicing involves hitting shuttlecock angled racquet face causing travel different direction suggested body arm movement slicing also causes shuttlecock travel slowly arm movement suggests example good crosscourt sliced drop shot use hitting action suggests straight clear smash deceiving opponent power direction shuttlecock sophisticated slicing action involves brushing strings around shuttlecock hit order make shuttlecock spin used improve shuttles trajectory making dip rapidly passes net example sliced low serve travel slightly faster normal low serve yet land spot spinning shuttlecock also used create spinning net shots also called tumbling net shots shuttlecock turns several times tumbles stabilizing sometimes shuttlecock remains inverted instead tumbling main advantage spinning net shot opponent unwilling address shuttlecock stopped tumbling since hitting feathers result unpredictable stroke spinning net shots especially important highlevel singles playersthe lightness modern racquets allows players use short hitting action many strokes thereby maintaining option hit powerful soft stroke last possible moment example singles player may hold racquet ready net shot flick shuttlecock back instead shallow lift notice opponent moved actual shot played shallow lift takes less time reach ground mentioned rally shuttlecock touches ground makes opponents task covering whole court much difficult lift hit higher bigger obvious swing short hitting action useful deception also allows player hit powerful strokes time big arm swing big arm swing also usually advised badminton bigger swings make difficult recover next shot fast exchanges use grip tightening crucial techniques often described finger power elite players develop finger power extent hit power strokes net kills less 10 centimetres 4 inches racquet swingit also possible reverse style deception suggesting powerful stroke slowing hitting action play soft stroke general latter style deception common rear court example drop shots disguised smashes whereas former style common forecourt midcourt example lifts disguised net shotsdeception limited slicing short hitting actions players may also use double motion make initial racquet movement one direction withdrawing racquet hit another direction players often send opponents wrong direction racquet movement typically used suggest straight angle play stroke crosscourt vice versa triple motion also possible rare actual play alternative double motion use racquet head fake initial motion continued racquet turned hit produces smaller change direction require much timeto win badminton players need employ wide variety strokes right situations range powerful jumping smashes delicate tumbling net returns often rallies finish smash setting smash requires subtler strokes example net shot force opponent lift shuttlecock gives opportunity smash net shot tight tumbling opponents lift reach back court makes subsequent smash much harder returndeception also important expert players prepare many different strokes look identical use slicing deceive opponents speed direction stroke opponent tries anticipate stroke may move wrong direction may unable change body momentum time reach shuttlecocksince one person needs cover entire court singles tactics based forcing opponent move much possible means singles strokes normally directed corners court players exploit length court combining lifts clears drop shots net shots smashing tends less prominent singles doubles smasher partner follow
